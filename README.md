# AcqSys Â¨ Acquistion System
During the development of AI algorithms, we need high-quality data. It is quite tough to get these data from the field because products in the field are not 
usually connected to the system. To solve this issue this firmware proposes to Design a ready-to-run acquisition system for monitoring electrical parameters 
like voltage, current, temperature, and noise. This system will have high accuracy on battery and low power and will be connected to the cloud
through LTE-M. Then we will analyse the data by using MATLAB & Simulink.Finally, it could be able to run local algorithms, and connect a local MATLAB to
the cloud to train/deploy AI algorithms.
